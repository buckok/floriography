                <h2>4. Speedwell</h2>
                <p>Enduring Beauty, Perserverance, Recovery</p>
                <p>Part of the genus Veronica, whose name is taken from St. Veronica, the saint famous for drying Christ's tears with her veil during his crucifixion. When he gave her the cloth back, it carried a vision of his face within it, and thus the veil took its place as an early relic in the Catholic Church. Speedwell, as a form of Veronica, has thus been associated with comfort, recovery, and its bright flowers came to represent the eyes of Christ.</p>
                <p>Before Christinanity took prominence in Western Culture, the speedwell held a vital place in Roman culture as well--the plant was widely regarded as an almost miraculous cure-all for ailments of many kinds. Though it has lost its medicinal use since then, the associate between Speedwell and recovery endures to the present. </p>

                <h2>5. Sweet Scabious</h2>
                <p>Widowhood, Unfortunate love</p>
                <p>"Scabiosa flowers were dark as garnet brooches; the nicotiana a veil of tossing crimson stars. Nothing was usual, or a dull color. All was exceptional, designed to be exceptional since it had been planned as the background for a beauty by the beauty" -Elizabeth Enright</p>
                <p>Unlike many of the flowers in this index, the origins of the scabious' name are less than poetic--it's derived from the Latin word "scabere" which means to scratch, probably because ancient Romans used the plant's blooms to treat scabies and other topical skin diseases and irritations. The flower is also colloquially called the pinwheel flower in reference to its perfectly rounded shape.</p>
                <p>The sweet scabious specifically comes only in a few shades ranging from dark purple to an almost black hue. In light of its dark petals, the bloom has historically been associated with love cut short, and with mourning brides and widows specifically. </p>
