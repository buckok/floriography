            <h2>What is Floriography?</h2>
            <p>For millennia, our relationship to the botanical world has captured the imagination of poets, scientists, prophets, and gods. Floriography, as its name suggests, encompasses the cryptography given to specific species of flora throughout recorded history. The Language of Flowers refers to a Victorian index of meanings attached to popular flowers spanning the early to mid-nineteenth century. In a period that featured a more constrained idealized courtship than those that came before it, this hidden labyrinth of meanings could allow lovers (both in heteronormative contexts and not) to communicate with each other away from prying eyes.</p>
            <p>This project marks the beginning stages of an in-depth curated and styled Floriography index. Though reference is made to the more traditional Victorian symbolism of flowers, the index also strives to take a more extensive and inclusive approach to each entry, offering alternative and overlapping cultural perspectives tied to each bloom wherever possible. Because of how brief these entries must be, the index invites the user to interpret this highly generalized approach as an invitation for further independent investigation.</p>
            <p>Each entry in the index is styled with a typical 3x5 index card in mind, and the interface is intended to give the user an experience of “flipping through” an antiquated library catalog card system.</p>

            <h2>The History of Floriography</h2>
            <p>The significance of botanicals in the surviving records of most cultures cannot be overstated, nor can an all-encompassing survey of that significance happen here. What this project aims to do is locate a discernible lineage between the meanings and symbols of botanicals today and the nexus of symbolism scattered in different temporalities and spaces. In certain records from ancient Egypt, for example, the discernable fascination with flowers cannot be overstated–Roman observations during the conquest of Caesar, for example, specifically call attention to the “overpowering fragrance of flowers” throughout the country.</p>
            <p>In Ancient Greece, most notably, multiple myths center around the origin of flowers, with common motifs focusing on the often tragic transformation of beautiful youths into particular blossoms brimming with physical symbolic interpretation.</p>
            <p>Countless cultures heavily rely on flowers in their religious rites, from celebrations of life and death in equal measure. The necks of sacrificial animals, for instance, often held garlands made with botanicals selected for highly individuated meaning.</p>
            <p>The Language of Flowers first emerged in its most familiar and taxonomic form, however in 1818, when a French glossary of flowers and their symbolism gained popularity in a Victorian culture reawakening to an ancient and medieval fascination with the natural world.</p>
