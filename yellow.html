                <h2>2. Daffodil</h2>
                <p>Beauty in Death, Vanity</p>
                <p>"What is meant by reality? It would seem to be something very erratic, very undependable--now to be found in a dusty road, now in a scrap of newspaper in the street, now a daffodil in the sun" Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own (1929)</p>
                <p>The Daffodil's genus (Narcissus) was originally given the name Narkissos by the Greeks due to its at times overpoweringly heady scent; they ascribed it with the power to act on the mind in the same way as a potent drug. Of course, its origins can also be traced to the original myth of Narcissus, the beautiful youth cursed to fall in love with his own reflection as a punishment for his coldness. After discovering ador in his own reflection, Narcisuss leaned down to the water's edge too far, slipped underneath, and drowned. Where he had knelt on the surface, a beautiful bloom sprang up from the earth. This is how the genus became associated with vanity and death. </p>
                <p>The Daffodil has also been linked to concepts of death, the underworld, and resurrection in other cultures. Ramses II's eyes and mouth were filled with Daffodils during his burial, and remnants of those blooms are traceable on his remains today.  </p>

                <h2>3. Goldenrod</h2>
                <p>Protection</p>
                <p>"Small creatures in the grass, as if realizing their days are numbered, cram the night air with sound. Everywhere goldenrod is full out" -Jean Hersey</p>

                <h2>4. Yellow Rose</h2>
                <p>Waning Love</p>
                <p>"A single rose, it's every rose/and this one--the irreplaceable one/the perfect one--a supple spoken word/framed by the text of things" -Rainer Maria Rilke, "Roses" (1926)</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, no other flower known to the Western world has held such a viseral place in the collective cultural imagination. According to historical sources, Cleopatra filled her pillows with rose petals, the Roman Emperor Nero had rose petals showered upon his guests. Early Christians associated the red rose with the Virgin Mary's suffering and the white with her joy, and ultimately the rose itself became associated with feminine sensuality from the antiquity to at least the nineteenth century.</p>
                <p>Yellow roses specifically have a distinct association with friendship and with fading love--their bright hue, though vibrant, differs drastically from varieties of roses meant to express the deepest love and devotion (read: a dozen long stemmed red roses). </p>

                <h2>5. Sunflower</h2>
                <p>Vitality, Loyalty, Pride</p>
                <p>"The sunflower is mine, in a way" -Vincent Van Gough</p>
                <p>A species native to North Central, and South America, the sunflower has enjoyed an essential role in the zeitgeits of countless cultures in and around these areas. During religious festivals in Peru, women wove garlands of sunflowers around their hair and pure gold chest plates depicting sunflowers have been recovered in former Incan land.</p>
                <p>First introduced to Europe through Spanish conquest in the mid-fourteenth century, the sunflower became associated with divinity, as its tendency to follow the sun wherever it moves in the sky served as a reminder of similar piety in European religious practice.</p>
