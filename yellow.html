                <h2>2. Daffodil</h2>
                <p>Beauty in Death, Vanity</p>
                <p>"What is meant by reality? It would seem to be something very erratic, very undependable--now to be found in a dusty road, now in a scrap of newspaper in the street, now a daffodil in the sun" Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own (1929)</p>
                <p>The Daffodil's genus (Narcissus) was originally given the name Narkissos by the Greeks due to its at times overpoweringly heady scent; they ascribed it with the power to act on the mind in the same way as a potent drug. Of course, its origins can also be traced to the original myth of Narcissus, the beautiful youth cursed to fall in love with his own reflection as a punishment for his coldness. After discovering ador in his own reflection, Narcisuss leaned down to the water's edge too far, slipped underneath, and drowned. Where he had knelt on the surface, a beautiful bloom sprang up from the earth. This is how the genus became associated with vanity and death. </p>
                <p>The Daffodil has also been linked to concepts of death, the underworld, and resurrection in other cultures. Ramses II's eyes and mouth were filled with Daffodils during his burial, and remnants of those blooms are traceable on his remains today.  </p>
