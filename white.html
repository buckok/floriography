                <h2>1. Calla Lily</h2>
                <p>Magnificent Beauty, Rebirth</p>
                <p>"The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower--suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day, and now I place them here in memory of something that has died" -Edna Ferber & George S Kaufman, The Stage Door (1936)</p>
                <p>The calla lily's common name comes from the Greek word kallos, which loosely means beauty. Unsurprisingly, the calla lily can trace its origin to another myth. According to some sources, the Roman goddess Venus saw the gratuitous beauty of the calla lily as a threat to her own--in her anger, she cursed the blossom, and that curse is what gives the flower its central spadix, or point. Though mostly ornamental, calla lilies actually can naturally absorb carbon dioxide, so some people keep them in their home to act as a natural air purifier.
                <p>In the Victorian era, calla lilies were often used in funeral arrangements, mostly due to their overt association with rebirth. This particular meaning also informs their prolific use in marriage ceremonies and their prevelance in Christian Easter services. </p>

                <h2>2. Lily of the Valley</h2>
                <p>Love's Good Fortune</p>
                <p>"I have considered the lilies/They never toil, they only bloom/They never feel chilly or tired or silly/And they don't need much room" -Connie Converse, "I Have Considered the Lilies"</p>
                <p>This bloom's name carries two meanings: on the one hand, Lily of the Valley invokes its habitual place of growth, that is, on hillsides and in valleys; on the other, the monks in Northern Europe who gave this flower its name intentionally invoked verse two in the Song of Songs, "I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley." </p>
                <p>Due to its primary season coming directly after the violet and before the rose (i.e. in the month of May), suitors in Nothern Europe began to believe gifting this bloom to the person of their affections would give luck to their efforts and eventual union. At one time, this flower was dedicated to the Germanic goddess of spring, Osara, and many a bonfinre was lit with flowers of the lily as offerings in her name.</p>

                <h2>3. Milkweed</h2>
                <p>Hope in Misery</p>
                <p>Quote about first flower</p>
                <p>Milkweed's genus, Asclepias, contains around two hundred species of plants, and draws its name from Asclepius, a Greek god of medicine. Milkweed specifically derives its name from a milky, viscous sap emitted from its cut stem. It can be used to treat sore throats, fevers, sores, asthma, and many other physical ailments. More than its medicinal legacy, however, Milkweed can be used to produce textiles, netting, fishing lines, and bow strings.</p>
                <p>During World War Two, children were paid to collect Milkweed floss, which would be used as the stuffing in life vests for naval soldiers. This, perhaps, informs the association between Milkweed and hope in despair; it became symbolic of a national rallying cry to be resourceful and contribute to any cause that may ensure victory. On a lighter note, Milkweed is also famous for its symbiotic relationship with the famous Monarch butterfly. The butterflies use Milkweed as the host for their eggs and therefore becomes one of the sole sources of food for Monarch caterpillars. In turn, Monarchs emerge as one of Milkweed's most prolific pollinators. This delicate relationship between particular pollinators and their host plants is as beautiful as it is fraught with fragility--it brings the precarious balances of inter-species relationships into the forefront.</p>

                <h2>4. Snowdrop</h2>
                <p>Hope</p>
                <p>"Moly the gods call it, and it is hard for mortal men to dig; but with the gods all things are possible"-Homer, <u>The Odyssey</u> Book 10, Line 302</p>
                <p>There is some scholarly speculation that the moly plant used by Odysseus to clear his mind of the witch Circe's pharmakeia was actually the Snowdrop. Indeed, the plant lays claim to a rather impressive medicinal legacy, and has been used historically for everything from treating headaches to regulating menstrual flow. Like a few other species in this index, modern science makes use of the Snowdrop as well, and it's been used in Alzheimer's studies and as a potential treatment for HIV.</p>
                <p>Symbolically speaking, however, the Snowdrop enjoys an equally rich legacy--due to their pattern of blooming right at winter's end, many cultures have come to associate the Snowdrop with new life. In several Central European cultures, the Snowdrop itself is featured as a mythological character, who, as a reward for being kind, was allowed to bloom before all other flowers.</p>

                <h2>5. Sweet William</h2>
                <p>Grant Me One Smile</p>
                <p>"William, who high upon the yard/Rocked with the billow to and fro,/Soon as her well-known voice he heard/He sighed, and cast his eyes below:"-John Gay, "Sweet William's Farewell to Black-Eyed Susan"</p>
                <p>Sweet William is also known as Dianthus, a word that takes its origin from a combination of the Greek words "dios" meaning "god" and "anthos" meaning "flower." Though meant to invoke the most magnificent flower of them all, being named the flower of the gods, the Sweet William is actually a pretty unassuming bloom that smells faintly of clove. Its common name, however, proves more difficult to trace, though the theory of it being named for the Bard himself feels like the most poetic option.</p>
                <p>The cultural legacy of the Sweet William flower diverges meaningfully from the prescribed gender roles of givers and receivers of flowers. In Victorian times, it proved commonplace for men to receive this bloom as a compliment on his bravery. As this index's entry for the Black-Eyed Susan suggests, the Sweet William flower may also derive its name from the John Gay poem about eternal love, and even before that, many old English folk heroes carried the name, like in the example "Fair Margaret and Sweet William."</p>
